This topic is the equivalent of the 2001 Census topic “Marital status”, but has undergone significant revision to take account of the Civil Partnership Act which came into force on 5 December 2005.

Marital and civil partnership states include: married/in a registered same-sex civil partnership; separated (but still legally married/in a registered same-sex civil partnership); divorced/formerly in a registered same-sex civil partnership; or widowed/surviving same-sex civil partner.

Although the term “single” is widely used to cover people in a number of states such as divorced or separated it is not a legally recognised status and was not an option on the census questionnaire. In census results the term “single” is used to refer only to someone who has never been married or in a registered same-sex civil partnership, which were options on the census questionnaire.","Mae statws priodasol a phartneriaeth sifil yn dosbarthu unigolyn yn ôl eu statws partneriaeth sifil cyfreithiol priodasol neu gofrestredig o'r un rhyw ar ddiwrnod y cyfrifiad, 27 Mawrth 2011.

Er bod y term “sengl” yn cael ei ddefnyddio'n helaeth i gynnwys pobl mewn nifer o wladwriaethau megis wedi ysgaru neu wahanu, nid yw'n statws a gydnabyddir yn gyfreithiol ac nid oedd yn opsiwn ar holiadur y cyfrifiad.

- Question 16 (England, Wales), Question 16 (Northern Ireland), Question 15 (Scotland): ‘What is your ethnic group?’
(same wording for all countries).

This question collected information on ethnic group, which classifies people according to their own perceived ethnic group and cultural background.

All countries instructed respondents to tick one box only. In addition, for England, Wales and Scotland, respondents were advised to tick one box ‘to best describe your ethnic
group or background’, and provided with guidance on how to answer the question based on the structure of responses under section headings.

Due to country specific requirements and user needs there are differences in question layout, ethnic group categories and labelling, category allocation and data collected. For
example:
- For some ethnic groups, some countries provide a specific tick box, whilst other countries have the option for allowing this ethnic group to be written in. For example, Scotland was the only country to include a ‘Polish’ tick box and Northern Ireland was the only country not to include an ‘Arab’ tick box, but respondents had the option to write in these ethnic groups for all countries.
- Some response options were more limited, for example, Northern Ireland had a tick box for ‘White’, whilst England, Wales and Scotland had separate tick boxes for ‘White British’, ‘White Irish’ etc.
- Some responses for some countries had geographical definitions, for example ‘African’ whilst others specify a colour prior to this, for example ‘Black / African / Caribbean / Black British’

Data outputs:
Univariate and multivariate outputs on ethnic group are available, at various levels of geography, for all countries.

Each country has its own ethnic group classification.

Due to country specific differences in data collected, question layout and response categories for the ethnic group question, along with country specific data processing rules, some responses are not directly comparable.","Dangosydd cymaroldeb: yn gymharol debyg

Casglodd y cwestiwn hwn wybodaeth am grŵp ethnig, sy'n dosbarthu pobl yn ôl eu grŵp ethnig canfyddedig eu hunain a chefndir diwylliannol.

13,Religion,Religion,Crefydd,"The voluntary question on religion in the 2011 Census was intended to capture people's religious affiliation and identification at the time of the Census irrespective of whether they practised or believed in that religion or how important it was in their lives.

If a person had no religion then the first of a series of tick boxes could be selected. Care should be taken when using these data not to infer, or allow the inference by others, that the practice of a religion or specific religious activities that are expected of believers has been measured. Unlike other census questions where missing answers are imputed, this question was voluntary, and where no answer was provided the response is categorised as 'not stated'.","Bwriad y cwestiwn gwirfoddol ar grefydd yng Nghyfrifiad 2011 oedd dal cysylltiad crefyddol pobl a'u hadnabod adeg y Cyfrifiad, ni waeth a oeddent yn ymarfer neu'n credu yn y grefydd honno neu pa mor bwysig oedd hi yn eu bywydau.

Data collected:
- Question 20 (England, Wales) ‘What is your religion?’
- Question 17 (Northern Ireland) ‘What religion, religious denomination or body do you belong to?’
- Question 13 (Scotland): Same as Northern Ireland

Whilst all countries asked a question on religion, different concepts were measured due to country specific user requirements and consistency with previous censuses:
- A question on affiliation, ‘What is your religion?’, was asked for England and Wales.
- A question on belonging, ‘What religion, religious denomination or body do you belong to?’ was asked for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Tick-box categories also varied across countries, in order to reflect country-specific user requirements and the largest denominations by population in each country:
- England and Wales: all Christian denominations were captured under the one ‘Christian’ tick box. Separate tick boxes were available for the remaining main religions, with an option to write in a religion.
- Scotland: three Christian tick boxes were available. Like England and Wales, there were separate tick boxes available for the remaining main religions in addition to the option to write in a religion.
- Northern Ireland: tick boxes provided for Christian denominations only, all other religions were captured as write-in responses.

In addition, all countries provided the following options:
- Tick box to record having no religion.
- To make the question voluntary, in accordance with the provisions of the Census Acts.

Data outputs:
Univariate and multivariate outputs are available on religion, at various levels of geography, for all countries.

Outputs differ across countries due to the differing information collected, for example, Northern Ireland and Scotland outputs include more detail for Christian religions, compared to England and Wales.

Where countries did not have a dedicated tick box for a religion and this was written in, counts can still be extracted in order to produce outputs, for example, Hindus in Northern Ireland.

Unlike other census questions where missing answers are imputed, as this question was voluntary, where no answer was provided the response is categorised as “not stated”.

Scotland have published table KS209SCa with the same religion output categories to provide a harmonised version to England and Wales outputs. Northern Ireland also produced a full detail religion table QS218NI which includes all religions with a count of 10 or more responses. However, where users choose to compare information on religion across countries, they must be aware that they are comparing different concepts and do so with caution. As a result, comparability is limited.

- Cwestiwn 13 (Yr Alban): Yr un fath â Gogledd Iwerddon

Er bod pob gwlad yn gofyn cwestiwn ar grefydd, mesurwyd gwahanol gysyniadau oherwydd gofynion defnyddwyr penodol a chysondeb â chyfrifiadau blaenorol:
- Cwestiwn ar ymlyniad, 'Beth yw eich crefydd?', Gofynnwyd i Gymru a Lloegr.
- Cwestiwn ar Berthyn, 'Pa grefydd, enwad crefyddol neu gorff ydych chi'n perthyn iddo?' Gofynnwyd am yr Alban a Gogledd Iwerddon.

- Cymru a Lloegr: Cafodd yr holl enwadau Cristnogol eu dal o dan y blwch ticio 'Cristion'. Roedd blychau ticio ar wahân ar gael ar gyfer y prif grefyddau sy'n weddill, gydag opsiwn i ysgrifennu mewn crefydd.
- Yr Alban: Roedd tri blychau ticio Cristnogol ar gael. Fel Cymru a Lloegr, roedd blychau ticio ar wahân ar gael ar gyfer y prif grefyddau sy'n weddill yn ogystal â'r opsiwn i ysgrifennu mewn crefydd.
- Gogledd Iwerddon: Ticiwch flychau a ddarperir ar gyfer enwadau Cristnogol yn unig, cafodd pob crefydd arall eu dal fel ymatebion ysgrifennu i mewn.

Yn ogystal, roedd pob gwlad yn darparu'r opsiynau canlynol:
- Ticiwch y blwch i gofnodi heb unrhyw grefydd.
- i wneud y cwestiwn yn wirfoddol, yn unol â darpariaethau Deddfau Cyfrifiad.

Mae allbynnau ansicr ac aml-gymysg ar gael ar grefydd, ar wahanol lefelau daearyddiaeth, ar gyfer pob gwlad.

Lle nad oedd gan wledydd flwch ticio pwrpasol ar gyfer crefydd a chafodd hyn ei ysgrifennu i mewn, gall cyfrif yn dal i gael eu tynnu er mwyn cynhyrchu allbynnau, er enghraifft, Hindwiaid yng Ngogledd Iwerddon.

Yn wahanol i gwestiynau cyfrifiad eraill lle mae atebion coll yn cael eu cyfrifo, gan fod y cwestiwn hwn yn wirfoddol, lle na ddarparwyd ateb, caiff yr ymateb ei gategoreiddio fel ""heb ei ddatgan"".

Mae'r Alban wedi cyhoeddi Tabl KS209SCA gyda'r un categorïau allbwn crefydd i ddarparu fersiwn wedi'i chysoni i allbynnau Cymru a Lloegr. Cynhyrchodd Gogledd Iwerddon hefyd fwrdd crefydd manylder llawn QS218NI sy'n cynnwys pob crefydd gyda chyfrif o 10 neu fwy o ymatebion. Fodd bynnag, lle mae defnyddwyr yn dewis cymharu gwybodaeth am grefydd ar draws gwledydd, rhaid iddynt fod yn ymwybodol eu bod yn cymharu gwahanol gysyniadau ac yn gwneud hynny yn ofalus.

Rather than a simple indicator of whether or not someone was currently in employment, it provides a measure of whether or not a person was an active participant in the labour market.

A person's economic activity is derived from their “activity last week”. This is an indicator of their status or availability for employment - whether employed, unemployed, or their status if not employed and not seeking employment. Additional information included in the economic activity classification is also derived from information about the number of hours a person works and their type of employment - whether employed or self-employed.","Mae gweithgarwch economaidd yn ymwneud ag a oedd person a oedd yn 16 oed a throsodd yn gweithio neu'n chwilio am waith yn ystod yr wythnos cyn y cyfrifiad ai peidio.

Lle mae defnyddwyr yn dymuno gwneud cymariaethau ar gyfer Cymru, Lloegr, yr Alban neu Ogledd Iwerddon ar yr un lefel ddaearyddol, gallant wneud hynny trwy gydgrynhoi'r categorïau manylach i'r lefel is o fanylder, fel sy'n berthnasol.

Er enghraifft, gellir cyfuno'r categorïau fel a ganlyn i alluogi cymhariaeth:
- 'A, B, D, E Amaethyddiaeth, Ynni a Dŵr'
- 'C Gweithgynhyrchu'
- 'F Construction'
- 'G, I Dosbarthu, Gwestai a Bwytai'
- 'H, J Trafnidiaeth a Chyfathrebu'
- 'K, L, M, N Ariannol, Real Estate, Proffesiynol a Gweithgareddau Gweinyddol'
- 'O, P, q Gweinyddiaeth Gyhoeddus, Addysg ac Iechyd'
- 'R, S, T, U Arall'

Noder bod y cwestiwn ar enw'r cyflogwr yn cael ei ddefnyddio i gynhyrchu amcangyfrifon cyfrifiad ond ni chaiff data ei gasglu ar gyfer cyhoeddi uniongyrchol.

This includes paid and unpaid overtime.","Nifer yr oriau yr oedd person 16 i 74 oed, mewn cyflogaeth yn ystod yr wythnos cyn y cyfrifiad, yn gweithio yn eu prif swydd. Mae hyn yn cynnwys goramser taledig a di-dâl.",Hours worked per week,,,"Indicator of comparability: Broadly comparable

Data collected:
- Question 42 (England, Wales): ‘In your main job, how many hours a week (including paid and unpaid overtime) do you usually work?’ (only for respondents who were working in the week before census)
- Question 42 (Northern Ireland): ‘In your main job, how many hours a week do (did) you usually work?’ (for those who are working or have worked in the past)
- Question 35 (Scotland): ‘How many hours (to the nearest full hour) a week do (did) you usually work in your main job?’ (for those who are working or have worked in the past)

For Scotland and Northern Ireland the respondent population was those who were working or had ever worked, outputs only include those in employment the week before Census. For England and Wales the respondent population was those who were working the week before census.

England, Wales, and Northern Ireland collected data from four tick boxes of hours worked: ’15 or less’, ’16 – 30’, ‘31 – 48’ and ’49 or more’. In contrast, Scotland
provided a write-in box for ‘Number of hours worked in a typical week’, to maintain continuity with their 2001 Census question.

Data output:
Univariate and multivariate outputs are available on hours worked, at various levels of geography, for all countries.

For England, Wales and Northern Ireland data are provided as four categories: ‘Part-time: 15 hours or less worked’, ‘Part-time: 16 to 30 hours worked’, ‘Full-time 31 to 48 hours worked’ and ‘Full-time 49 or more hours worked’.

Scotland provide two versions of outputs on hours worked. A country specific output (from
the write-in, with eight categories of data: ‘Part-time: 1 to 2 hours’, ‘Part-time: 3 to 5 hours’,
‘Part-time: 6 to 15 hours’, ‘Part-time: 16 to 30 hours’, ‘Full-time: 31 to 37 hours’, ‘Full-time:
38 to 48 hours’, ‘Full-time: 49 to 59 hours’ and ‘Full-time: 60 hours or more’) and a version
of four categories for comparison with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

As a result of differences in populations from which hours worked information was
collected, data should be compared across countries with caution.

Are UK outputs available?
Yes. Data for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are available as four categories of hours worked:
- Part-time: 15 hours or less worked
- Part-time: 16 to 30 hours worked
- Full-time 31 to 48 hours worked
- Full-time 49 or more hours worked","Dangosydd cymaroldeb: yn gymharol debyg

Data a gasglwyd:
- Cwestiwn 42 (Cymru, Lloegr): 'Yn eich prif swydd, faint o oriau yr wythnos (gan gynnwys goramser a dalwyd a di-dâl) ydych chi fel arfer yn gweithio?' (Dim ond i ymatebwyr a oedd yn gweithio yn yr wythnos cyn y cyfrifiad)
- Cwestiwn 42 (Gogledd Iwerddon): 'Yn eich prif swydd, faint o oriau yr wythnos a wnewch chi fel arfer yn gweithio?' (I'r rhai sy'n gweithio neu sydd wedi gweithio yn y gorffennol)
- Cwestiwn 35 (Yr Alban): 'Faint o oriau (i'r awr lawn agosaf) yr wythnos a wnewch chi fel arfer yn gweithio yn eich prif swydd?' (I'r rhai sy'n gweithio neu sydd wedi gweithio yn y gorffennol)

Ar gyfer yr Alban a Gogledd Iwerddon, y boblogaeth ymatebydd oedd y rhai a oedd yn gweithio neu erioed wedi gweithio, ond mae allbynnau yn cynnwys y rhai mewn cyflogaeth yr wythnos cyn y cyfrifiad. Ar gyfer Cymru a Lloegr, y boblogaeth ymatebydd oedd y rhai a oedd yn gweithio yr wythnos cyn y cyfrifiad.

Casglodd Cymru, Lloegr, a Gogledd Iwerddon ddata o bedwar blychau tic o oriau a weithiwyd: '15 neu lai ', '16 - 30', '31 - 48 'a '49 neu fwy'. Ar y llaw arall, yr Alban
darparu blwch ysgrifennu i mewn ar gyfer 'nifer yr oriau a weithir mewn wythnos nodweddiadol', er mwyn cynnal parhad gyda'u cwestiwn cyfrifiad 2001.
